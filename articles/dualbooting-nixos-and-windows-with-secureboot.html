            result)</h2>
            <p>I am currently running Windows 11 and NixOS 24.11 on the same laptop on the same NVME
            drive. I am using <code>systemd-boot</code> as my bootloader to easily switch between my
            Windows and NixOS installations. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot">Secure Boot</a> was enabled using
            <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote">lanzaboote</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="preface-do-not-skip-this">Preface (Do Not Skip This)</h2>
            <p>You will need to wipe your disk so first of all <strong>backup you data</strong>.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>For dual booting, the Windows install instructions is a bit different so do read
            through it.</p>
            <p>First you will be installing Windows and then NixOS. Since NixOS does not support
            secureboot out of the box yet you will have to make it work by installing <a
            href="https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote">lanzaboote</a>.</p>

            date.</li>
            <li>Having full disk encryption (bitlocker on Windows) is good, but if things go wrong
            it will be harder to recover your data. It’s still possibe to recover your data but a
            bit harder. Still, use bitlocker if you have to.</li>

            <h3 id="preparing-the-iso">Preparing the ISO</h3>
            <p>A regular Windows ISO will do.</p>
            <p>To flash the ISO to a USB drive I used <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a> form
            another Windows machine. If you are using rufus then before flashing the iso to a usb
            drive rufus will give you the option to disable bitlocker encryption, i recommend
            enabling this. If you did not get this option then continue as bitlocker can be disabled
            after installing Windows. (Refer <strong>After Installing Windows</strong> section)</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>You can enable bitlocker from Windows after installing both Windows and NixOS and
            installing lanzaboote.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Disabling bitlocker is important</strong> for the install process beacuse
            bitlocker depends on secureboot and we need to disable secureboot for installing NixOS.
            If secure boot is disabled and you have enabled bitlocker you won’t be able to simply
            boot into Windows, you will have to get your bitlocker decryption key.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="installing-windows">Installing Windows</h3>
            <p>During Windows installation select
            <code>Custom: Install Windows Only (advanced)</code>. You will be asked select which
            drive to install to and to setup the partitions. You will need to setup a large EFI
            partition (500MB to 1GB) for dualbooting as the default EFI partition size on Windows is
            just 100MB which is too small for sual booting. You can do this by following this
            guide.</p>
            <p><a
            href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/how-to-esp-windows-setup.html">https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/how-to-esp-windows-setup.html</a></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>If you are ever planning to dual boot anything with Windows please consider creating
            a larger EFI partition than what Windows defaults to during Windows install.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>I have gone with a 1GB EFI partition on my system</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="after-installing-windows">After Installing Windows</h3>
            <p>If you have not disabled bitlocker from rufus or used another tool to flash the iso
            or did not get the disable bitlocker option in rufus then it is time to do it now.
            Follow this guide if you are not sure how to do it.</p>
            <p><a
            href="https://www.howtogeek.com/805225/disable-bitlocker/">https://www.howtogeek.com/805225/disable-bitlocker/</a></p>
            <p>Now you will have to shrink the current Windows partition to make space for NixOS. If
            you are not sure how to do it the follow this guide.</p>
            <p><a
            href="https://www.howtogeek.com/212/resize-a-partition-on-Windows/">https://www.howtogeek.com/212/resize-a-partition-on-Windows/</a></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The guide shows you different methods to shrink / expand partitions, but you only
            need to shrink the partition.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>You will need to shrink the partition for as much space you need because resizing
            partitions after installing both OSs might not be feasable.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2 id="nixos-installation">NixOS Installation</h2>
            <h3 id="before-installation">Before Installation</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Make sure that <strong>bitlocker is disabled</strong> on Windows.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have shrank the Windows partition to make space for NixOS</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>⚠️ <strong>DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THIS</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Now you will need to <strong>disable secure boot</strong> from the system’s BIOS. The
            process for this will be different based on your system’s manufacturer so please look it
            up and do the necessary.</p>
            <p>You will have to flash the NixOS ISO to a usb drive and boot into it. I used <a
            href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a> for this also. Again booting from a usb drive will be
            different based on your system’s manufacturer so please look it up and do the
            necessary.</p>
            <h3 id="installing-nixos">Installing NixOS</h3>
            <p>During installation you will be asked to which partition NixOS should be installed.
            Here select replace a partition. On the partition figure given below that click on the
            unallocated space (grey colour) that you made by shrinking the Windows partition.
            Continue the installation and you will have NixOS installed with systemd-boot as the
            bootloader.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Be careful when doing this step, do not select the wrong partition.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="after-installing-nixos">After Installing NixOS</h3>
            <p>You have to now go to the bios again and set the default boot option as <em>Linux
            Boot Manager</em>. Now when you boot the system you will be able to select which OS you
            want to boot into.</p>
            <p>But now we have a problem, - Secure boot is not enabled. If it is enabled again then
            we cannot boot into NixOS using the Linux Boot Manager option anymore.</p>
            <p>To fix this we have to setup NixOS for secure boot. For this we are going to use a
            project called <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote">lanzaboote</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="installing-lanzaboote">Installing Lanzaboote</h2>
            <p>Do not follow the instructions for installing lanzaboote from the NixOS wiki as this
            might be out of date and definitely <strong>DO NOT select reset all secureboot
            keys</strong> anywhere in the bios (you will get what I mean from the lanzaboote
            docs).</p>
            <p>You will have to follow the lanzaboote docs to install lanzaboote onto your NixOS
            system. For this simply follow the lanzaboote docs.</p>
            <p><a
            href="https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/blob/master/docs/QUICK_START.md">https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/blob/master/docs/QUICK_START.md</a></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>There are two methods given in the lanzaboote docs to install secureboot, one using
            nix flakes and another using niv. Use the niv method if you are not using nix flakes to
            configure your system.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you followed all the instructions properly you should have a system that can dual
            boot NixOS and Windows and has secure boot enabled.</p>

            href="https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Dual_Booting_NixOS_and_Windows">here</a>. It also
            talks about things like how to make the bootloader detect Windows (In our case Windows
            would be automatically detected), how to use grub instead of systemd-boot as the
            bootloader and about dual booting using different drive configurations.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <strong>System Time</strong> section from <a
            href="https://wiki.nixos.org">https://wiki.nixos.org</a> to make sure that time on
            Windows remains in sync when dualbooting.</p>

            <h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>
            <p>Here are some general tips for using your dual bootable system</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To clear NixOS generations from the systemd-boot screen you need to run the
            <code>nix-collect-garbage</code> command and then also rebuild the system.</li>
            <li>systemd-boot has some keyboard shortcuts to set an entry as the default entry, set
            the time to auto select the default entry etc. You can find that <a
            href="https://systemd.io/BOOT/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>If you want to switch from Windows to NixOS while in Windows instead of powering off
            and the starting the system select reboot from Windows. In Windows powering off and then
            on again is not the same as a reboot <a
            href="https://www.howtogeek.com/349114/shutting-down-doesnt-fully-shut-down-windows-10-but-restarting-it-does/">Shutting
            Down Doesn’t Fully Shut Down Windows 10</a>. Although there is no actual proof that
            restarting is better to switch from Windows to another OS I still recommend restarting
            to switch to a different OS.</li>
